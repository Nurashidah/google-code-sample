# google-code-sample
Creating a command line application stimulating Youtube. This is my take on the challenge given by Google during Bright Network Internship Experience. 

I have forked this project from internship-experience-uk/google-code-sample and have only the chance to make changes in the google-code-sample/python/src/video_player.py/ file. 

I want to thank Bright Network for this opportunity as I have learn and gain more knowledge on Technology industry in the career world.
